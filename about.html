            <h1> A little bit about me. </h1>
            <p>Hello, My name is Bryan Pearson. I am Computer Science student at the
                University of Wisconsin at Parkside and maintain a 3+ GPA. I have knowledge of several languages including Java, Python,
                C, C++, Visual Basic, HTML5 - CSS, PHP, and SQL. At Parkside Java is the main language,
                so I am most familiar with it, but Python is becoming my favorite language.</p>

            <p> I have worked with several IDE's
                and I am comfortable learning any new environments and or languages as need be.
                I enjoy programming and figuring things out.
                For the summer of 2015 I had an internship at Tricore Inc. where I set up
                PC's, servers, and did some VB programming. I have also been building HMI's in VB, working with SQL,
                and restoring databases. It was an excelent learning experience that helped guide me in my career
                choice. I am looking forward to graduating in the fall of 2016 focusing on web development
                and the security concerns that go with web applications.<br></p>
                <p>Below is some of my relevant work experience:<br>

            </p>


            <P> I am married, father of two boys, and I like being outdoors. I enjoy
                a good steak and good company. I play the guitar, mostly acoustical, and also
                play farmer. I love the ah ha moment when something I
                have been working finally comes together. I am hardworking and dedicated to
                the task at hand. A self starter that also likes to work in a group environment.<br /></p>
